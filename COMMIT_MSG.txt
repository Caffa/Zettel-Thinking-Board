Refactor settings: collapsible model blocks, UX philosophy, unique color alert

Settings UI/UX overhaul so each model is configured in one place and node
colors stay one-to-one.

What changed
------------
- Execution: Each of Primary / Secondary / Tertiary is a single collapsible
  block (<details>) containing Model (dropdown or text), Label, and Color.
  Primary is expanded by default; secondary and tertiary start collapsed.
  Summary line updates when model or label changes (e.g. "Primary model —
  llama2") so users can scan without opening.
- Display: Renamed from "Node colors". Now only Python, Comment, and Output
  colors plus "Show role labels"; model colors live inside each model block.
  Added a short hint that each node type should have a unique color.
- Color conflict: When the user picks a color already used by another node
  type, an alert explains that each type should have a unique color. Helper
  getOtherRoleWithColor() and ROLE_DISPLAY_NAMES support the message.
- README: New "Settings and UX" section describing grouping by concept,
  progressive disclosure, execution-first order, and one-to-one colors.

Philosophy (documented in code and README)
------------------------------------------
- Group by concept, not by control type: one place per model (model + label
  + color).
- Progressive disclosure: collapsible blocks; primary visible by default.
- Summary shows current choice when collapsed for quick scanning.
- Execution first (what runs), then Display (how it looks for non-model
  nodes and labels).
- One-to-one color mapping: no two node types share a color; alert on
  conflict so the canvas stays easy to read.

Technical
---------
- addModelBlock() builds one collapsible block; addColorSetting() now
  calls checkColorConflict() after dropdown/hex change.
- COLOR_ROLES and getOtherRoleWithColor() for conflict detection.
- CSS: .ztb-model-block, .ztb-model-block-summary, .ztb-model-block-content
  (arrow rotation when open).
